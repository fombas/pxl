Assignments for students at PXL Hasselt.

## Assignment 1 - Amazon Chronos

**Objective**: Understand how recent foundational models can be used for time series predictions.

**Method**: Run the minimal example explained in the [amazon git repo](https://github.com/amazon-science/chronos-forecasting?tab=readme-ov-file).  Adapt the code to answer the questions below.

**Questions**:
- Is the predicted behavior logical?
- Do we need (cross-)validation?
- What happens if you increase the prediction length (to 5 years after the last available data point)?
- Change the model to the “tiny” version and analyze how this changes the results. 
- Apply the model on a new dataset (eg. sensor-1.csv with prediction length of 64, or an example you generate or download yourself).
